# pwa-Budget-Tracker

## Purpose
The purpose of this app is to update an existing budget tracker application and allow for offline access and functionality. The idea is to allow a user to add expenses and incomes to their budget with or without an internet connection. When the user adds a transaction while the app is offline, they should have their totals updated when they go back online.
